# OpenPass
Hey there! Welcome to the future home of OpenPass—a desktop-based, open-source password manager that's all about security, privacy, and ease of use. I’m currently working on this project with the goal of launching it sometime in 2025. But first things first, let’s get into what this project is all about and how you can get involved if you’d like.
What is OpenPass?

OpenPass is a desktop application designed to help you securely manage your passwords and other sensitive information across all your devices. It’s built with privacy in mind—your data stays yours and only yours.
